Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
The purpose of this project was to develop a system that helps calculate the users investment with and without compound interest. 

What did you do particularly well?
What I did well was structuring the code and making sure I described what was going on with the in-text comments. The implementation of the multiple files makes it more organized and 
easier to navigate for users to edit and review.

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I could implement input validation to ensure the user inputs only valid choices. 

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
The most challenging part was handling the item frequency histogram and ensuring that the output correctly aligns, both in the number of asterisks and visually. I overcame this by using the setw() function from <iomanip> to handle text alignment. I kept using online resources like w3schools and stack overflow to gain more insight for these types of scenarios.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
Building maps and the functionality of the codes will be transferable to other projects. The structured design using encapsulation and private data ensures the program is maintainable and adaptable that will apply to future coursework.

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I used comments throughout the code to make it easier for others to understand and maintained a similar format to make sure it is easy to distinguish and makes the code look a lot more organized and clean to the eyes.
